                <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, beginning students have the opportunity to build 2 incredibly simple, fun Rock Paper Scissors projects. The first is a simple RPS simulator as one of the first coding projects they ever do. This project was built for a 40 hour workshop that covers 3 projects, with our previous Nifty project, 2048, bridging the gap. Then, the third project in the sequence, which is a natural extension of RPS, provides a high level introduction to concepts in Artificial Intelligence for beginning students in a fun, easy to grasp way.</p>

                    <p>Since these two projects are targeted towards CS0 and CS1 students and heavily interrelated, they ship together in the same repository and utilize the same autograder framework, though they have separate specs. The project includes skeleton code and plenty of hints to make sure students can get ‘unstuck’ and the comprehensive autograder ensures that their implementations are completely correct before moving on.</p>

                    <h3 id="example-methods">Example Methods</h3>
                    <p>Here are a few examples of the type of methods the students would be responsible for understanding or implementing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Project 0 — RPS
                            <ul>
                                <li><tt>play_again: </tt>returns "True" if user wants to play again and "False" if not</li>
                                <li><tt>determine_winner: </tt>determines the winner between the user and computer based on each of the players’ moves</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> Project 2 — AI Extensions
                            <ul>
                                <li><tt>biased_strategy: </tt>has a single weighted move, equal split for other two</li>
                                <li><tt>deterministic_strategy: </tt>repeats a pattern of moves</li>
                                <li><tt>reflexive_strategy: </tt>Keeps track of all past opponent moves and adjusts weights/probability of playing each move</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="abstraction-reference-guide">Abstraction Reference Guide</h3>
                    <p>All 3 Nifty projects (RPS, 2048, and the AI Extensions) rely on a central principle of abstraction and this concept is reinforced throughout the set of projects. All 3 projects also include an “Abstraction Reference Guide” which helps students understand all provided and student-implemented functions. These also continue to strengthen the idea of creating abstraction barriers and allows the students to focus on the problem at hand, rather than be overwhelmed by the entire project.</p>

                    <h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
                    <p>Overall, the projects are applicable, interesting, and directly relevant to students while also building systems of increasing complexity that challenges your 10x student programmers while providing enough support to the rest of the class to help them push through problems. Teachers will find that they also don’t need to micromanage students’ code as they get instant feedback from comprehensive tests and grading is made easy with the provided autograder.</p>

It was tested with students that had ~10 hours of lecture/lab/homework who started as complete beginners coming into this project.</p><p>AI extensions builds on the knowledge and comfort students acquire after working through many more problems and the two aforementioned projects. We recommend they have closer to 30-40 hours of lecture/lab/homework coming into the project so that they’re more comfortable writing code from scratch and building agents. At that point, they likely also would have had adequate experience with debugging problems and that is a key skill the AI Extensions in particular help develop in students.</p></td>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>building a challenging, complex strategy with less handholding from the spec</li>
                                    <li>engineering an all-knowing simulator that “cheats” by looking at the User’s choice and beating it every time</li>
                                    <li>Learning about and utilizing memoization to make the predictive strategies much faster and more efficient</li>
                                </ol>
                            Each of these challenges taken alone would be a challenge for most CS1 students and the combination of the 3 should keep anyone who completes the projects early very occupied.</p></td>
